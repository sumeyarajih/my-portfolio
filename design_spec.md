# Portfolio Design Specification
**Client:** Sumeya Rajih Abass  
**Role:** Software Engineer (Flutter, UI/UX) & Full Stack Developer  
**Vibe:** Clean, Bold, Trustworthy  

## 1. Design Principles & Aesthetics

### Core Philosophy
*   **Clean:** Abundant whitespace, clutter-free interfaces, and precise alignment. The design should breathe.
*   **Bold:** High-contrast typography and strategic use of the **Orange** accent color to draw attention to call-to-actions (CTAs) and key skills.
*   **Trustworthy:** Professional typography, consistent spacing, and clear, accessible content presentation. High-quality visuals of work.

### Color Palette
A high-contrast, modern palette.
*   **Primary Background:** `#FFFFFF` (White) - For the main canvas, keeping it clean.
*   **Primary Text:** `#1A1A1A` (Almost Black) - For headings and body text to ensure readability but softer than pure black.
*   **Accent / Brand Color:** `#FF6B00` (Vibrant Orange) or `#FD7E14` - Used for primary buttons, active states, and highlighting key words/graphics.
*   **Secondary Elements:** `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray) - For subtle section backgrounds or card borders.
*   **Clean Black:** `#000000` - For boldest headers or primary buttons (if not orange).

**Usage Rule:** 
*   Backgrounds are predominantly white.
*   Text is black/dark grey.
*   **Orange** is used sparingly but effectively (e.g., the "Hire Me" button, skill progress bars, or hover effects).

### Typography
*   **Headings:** *Space Grotesk*, *Outfit*, or *Syne*. (Bold, modern sans-serifs with personality).
*   **Body:** *Inter*, *DM Sans*, or *Plus Jakarta Sans*. (Highly readable, clean, modern).

## 2. Layout Ideas & User Journey

### A. Hero Section (The First Impression)
*   **Layout:** Split screen or Centered aligned.
*   **Content:**
    *   **Headline:** "Building Digital Experiences with Precision & Passion." (Bold, Large).
    *   **Sub-headline:** "Hi, I'm **Sumeya Rajih Abass**. I craft pixel-perfect UI/UX and robust mobile/web applications."
    *   **Visual:** A stylized 3D or high-quality photo of you/mockups of your mobile apps (Flutter) and web dashboards.
    *   **CTAs:** Two clear buttons:
        *   Primary (Orange Background, White Text): "View My Work"
        *   Secondary (Black Border, Black Text): "Contact Me"

### B. About / Skills (The "Trust" Builder)
*   **Layout:** Grid-based cards or a dynamic tag cloud.
*   **Idea:** Since you do both Design and Dev, split skills visually:
    *   **Left Column (Designer):** UI/UX, Figma, Adobe XD. icon: 🎨
    *   **Right Column (Developer):** Flutter, React, Vue, Laravel, DBs. icon: 💻
*   **Visuals:** Use clean icons (outline style) in Orange or Black.

### C. Featured Projects (The Proof)
*   **Layout:** Masonry grid or Large Alternating Cards.
*   **Card Design:**
    *   Large thumbnail (Video editing skills can be showcased here too with GIFs/Video previews).
    *   **Tags:** (e.g., "Flutter", "Postgres").
    *   **Minimal Text:** Project Title + One line description.
    *   **Action:** "View Case Study" (Arrow icon).
*   **Hover Effect:** Slight lift + Orange shadow or border reveal.

### D. Experience / History
*   **Layout:** Vertical Timeline.
*   **Style:** Minimalist line with dots. Active/latest role highlighted in Orange.

### E. Contact / Footer
*   **Layout:** Clean, centered or simple 2-column.
*   **Vibe:** Welcoming. "Let's build something amazing together."
*   **Elements:** Email link, Social icons (LinkedIn, GitHub, Behance), Copyright.

## 3. UI/UX Details for "Trustworthy" Feel
*   **Micro-interactions:** Buttons slightly scale on hover. Links verify with an orange underline.
*   **Consistency:** All margins and paddings follow a strict grid (e.g., 8px grid system).
*   **Fast Load:** Critical for a developer portfolio.
